# ETFS Command Line Interface

## Current status

This is a work-in-progress technical preview — it's ready to use, but the developer experience is not yet streamlined.


## Setup

Run `curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dx-tooling/etfs-cli/refs/heads/main/install.sh | bash`


## Scratchbook

Quick test-drive in Ubuntu 24.04:

```bash
docker run -it --rm -v "$(pwd):/root/src" ubuntu:24.04 bash
```

This mounts the project root into the container at `~/src` and starts an interactive bash session.


## Background

This is a project from [the DX·Tooling initiative](https://dx-tooling.org/).
